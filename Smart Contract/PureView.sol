/*

View functions in Solidity are designed to retrieve and return data from the blockchain 
without modifying the state of the contract. These functions are used to provide read-only 
access to the contract's state variables.

In Solidity, a function that doesnâ€™t read or modify the variables of the state is called a 
pure function. It can only use local variables that are declared in the function and the 
arguments that are passed to the function to compute or return a value.
